class Set(base.Base):
    """Approximate tracking of observed items using Bloom filters.

    Bloom filters enable using a limited amount of memory to check whether a given item was already
    observed in a stream. They can be used similarly to Python's built-in sets with the difference
    that items are not explicitly stored. For that reason, element removal and set difference are not
    currently supported.

    Bloom filters store a bit array and map incoming items to `k` index positions in the such array.
    The selected positions are set to `True`. Therefore, a binary code representation is created for each item.
    Membership works by projecting the query item and checking if every position of its binary code is
    `True`. If that is not the case, the item was not observed yet. A nice property of Bloom filters is
    that they do not yield false negatives: unobserved items might be signalized as observed, but observed
    items are never signalized as unobserved.

    If more than one item has the same binary code, i.e., hash collisions happen, the accuracy of the Bloom
    filter decreases, and false positives are produced. For instance, a previously unobserved item is signalized
    as observed. Increasing the size of the binary array and the value of `k` increase the filter's accuracy as
    hash collisions are avoided. Nonetheless, even using an increased number of hash functions, hash collisions
    will frequently happen if the array capacity is too small. The length of the bit array and the number of
    hash functions are inferred automatically from the supplied `capacity` and `fp_rate`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    capacity
        The maximum capacity of the Bloom filter, i.e., the maximum number of distinct items to store given
        the selected `fp_rate`.
    fp_rate
        The allowed rate of false positives. The probability of obtaining a true positive is `1 - fp_rate`.
    seed
        Random seed for reproducibility.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import random
    >>> from river import sketch

    >>> rng = random.Random(42)
    >>> s_set = sketch.Set(capacity=100, seed=0)


    We can retrieve the number of selected hash functions:

    >>> s_set.n_hash
    7

    And the size of the binary array used by the Bloom filter:
    >>> s_set.n_bits
    959

    We can add new items and check for membership using the same calls used by Python's
    standard sets:
    >>> for _ in range(1000):
    ...     s_set.add(rng.randint(0, 200))

    >>> 1 in s_set
    True

    False positives might happen if the capacity is not large enough:
    >>> -10 in s_set
    True

    Iterables can also be supplied to perform multiple updates with a single call to `update`:
    >>> s_set = s_set.update([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

    We can also combine instances of `sketch.Set` using the intersection and union operations, as long as
    they share the same hash functions and capability. In other words, all they hyperparameters match.
    Let's create two instances that will monitor different portions of a stream of random numbers:

    >>> s1 = sketch.Set(seed=8)
    >>> s2 = sketch.Set(seed=8)

    >>> for _ in range(1000):
    ...     s1.add(rng.randint(0, 5000))

    >>> for _ in range(1000):
    ...     s2.add(rng.randint(0, 5000))

    >>> 43 in s1
    True
    >>> 43 in s2
    False

    We can get the intersection between the two instances by using:

    >>> s_intersection = s1 & s2
    >>> 43 in s_intersection
    False

    We can also obtain the set union:

    >>> s_union = s1 | s2

    >>> 43 in s_union
    True

    The same effect of the non-inplace dunder methods can be achieved via explicit method calls:

    >>> 43 in s1.intersection(s2)
    False

    >>> 43 in s1.union(s2)
    True

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation uses an integer to represent the binary array. Bitwise operations are performed in the
    integer to reflect the Bloom filter updates.
